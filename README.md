# Local password

For better security and prevent potential hacker activity I decided to implement a local password.\
This password will allow the user to open the SaveNet application.\
For who don't know this password SaveNet won't be opened so unauthorized person can't decrypt secured files.

This algorithm take a letter and convert into an ASCII code added by a calculation process.
